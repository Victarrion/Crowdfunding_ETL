The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:

-Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
-Create the Campaign DataFrame
-Create the Contacts DataFrame

Following the creating of the needed files a SQL DB was created following the instructions provided:
Create the Crowdfunding Database
-Inspect the four CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBD 
-Use the information from the ERD to create a table schema for each CSV file.
-Save the database schema as a Postgres file named crowdfunding_db_schema.sql, and save it to your GitHub repository.

-Create a new Postgres database, named crowdfunding_db (found in the resources file).

-Using the database schema, create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

-Verify the table creation by running a SELECT statement for each table.

-Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

-Verify that each table has the correct data by running a SELECT statement for each.
